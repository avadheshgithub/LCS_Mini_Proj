## 📖 About The Project

This project demonstrates the **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)** algorithm using **Dynamic Programming**. It is part of the **Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)** curriculum and helps understand optimal substructure and overlapping subproblem.

---

## 🧠 What is LCS?

> The Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) is the longest sequence which appears **in the same order** in both strings but not necessarily **contiguously**.

### 🧪 Example
      Input: X = "ABCDEF" Y = "AEBDF"
      
      Output: LCS = "ABDF", Length = 4

      LCS = "ABDF"

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Dynamic Programming implementation
- ✅ Command line input support
- ✅ Works for any two strings
- ✅ Time and space efficient
- ✅ Clear output display
